# PHP namespace autoloader
Messing around with some PHP namespaced class autoloading examples.

With probably some of the worst class naming examples in the history of object oriented teachings. I'm *not* very creative today.

Requires PHP 5.3+, where of course [namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) first made their appearance.
